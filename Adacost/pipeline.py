               Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. By default, no caching is performed. If a string
               is given, it is the path to the caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of the transformers
               before fitting. Therefore, the transformer instance given to the pipeline cannot be inspected directly.
               Use the attribute "named_steps" or "steps" to inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the
               transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming.
